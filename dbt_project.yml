quoting:
  database: false       # Optional, usually not needed
  schema: false         # Optional, usually not needed
  identifier: true      # âœ… This ensures table names are quoted
# In this example config, we tell dbt to build all models in the example/
# directory as views. These settings can be overridden in the individual model
# files using the `{{ config(...) }}` macro.
